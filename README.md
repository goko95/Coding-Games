# Coding-Games
I am not sure, if it's ok to share this, but the web-site is free, so I think it's ok. Check out the website, please. Let me know, if it's not ok to share this. My goal is not to steal, but to record my progress so again please let me know. Thanks.

I'll be sharing both the initial code that was given by the site and the I'll put what I have done, in that order in the same file. I'll name the files by the same names on the website. I'll also include the date.
