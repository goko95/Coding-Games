# Coding-Games
I am not sure, if it's ok to share this, but the web-site is free, so I think it's ok. Check out the website, please. Let me know, if it's not ok to share this. My goal is not to steal, but to record my progress so again please let me know. Thanks.

I'll be sharing both the initial code that was given by the site and the I'll put what I have done, in that order in the same file. I'll name the files by the same names on the website. I'll also include the date.

I honestly find this web-site very useful. It is like solving sudoku or puzzle, but it's for code. I want to thank it's creators, however I am a very beginner on coding and even the beginner level puzzles are hard for me to do. This is either because I am not even a beginner (what I mean is that I don't have what a beginner level programmer have to have), or this is not really well adjusted as in level design due to it difficulty curve. However, I don't really care about this situation. I believe that the instructions are well written and so it can be simplified down to the level, where I am at.

Again please do check out the web-site.

Thanks,
GÃ¶kalp Ergenekon
