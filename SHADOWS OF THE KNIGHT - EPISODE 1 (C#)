//My part

/*
  So I have tried to do this puzzle for a long time now. However, there were some structures, which I had no idea
  about how they work and what they do, so I started to search what they have done, but searching them one by one
  didn't really work. Plus it took so much time that I got bored and pissed, so I have decided to search o YouTube,
  however that was not very helpful either. So I decided to build the code they have build in a way that I would
  understand with my knowledge at the moment.
  
  Here are some of the videos that I have watched, I hope you'll find them useful:

/*
  So this is what I have got so far. Even this version has a lot of changes on them and I'll try to explain them:
    1. In the fist time I started the code these codes were not like this
    
            //(batmanCol > col || batmanRow > row) || (bombCol == batmanCol && bombRow == batmanRow) || (bombCol > col || bombRow > row)

            while (true) //This is to make sure everything is set up correctly
            {
                while (batmanCol > col || batmanRow > row) //This is to prevent "Out of Range" exception
                    if (batmanRow > row)
                        batmanRow = kb.Next(9);
                    else if (batmanCol > col)
                        batmanCol = kb.Next(9);

                while (bombCol > col || bombRow > row) //This is to prevent "Out of Range" exception
                    if (bombRow > row)
                        bombRow = kb.Next(9);
                    else if (bombCol > col)
                        bombCol = kb.Next(9);

                while (bombCol == batmanCol && bombRow == batmanRow) //This is to prevent an automatic win
                {
                    if (bombCol == batmanCol)
                    {
                        bombCol = kb.Next(9);
                        batmanCol = kb.Next(9);
                    }
                    else if (bombRow == batmanRow)
                    {
                        bombRow = kb.Next(9);
                        batmanRow = kb.Next(9);
                    }
                }

                if (batmanCol <= col && batmanRow <= row)
                    if (bombCol <= col && bombRow <= row)
                        if (batmanCol != bombCol && batmanRow != bombRow)
                            break;
            }
            
    It was like this instead:
       
                while (bombCol == batmanCol && bombRow == batmanRow) //This is to prevent an automatic win
                {
                    if (bombCol == batmanCol)
                    {
                        bombCol = kb.Next(9);
                        batmanCol = kb.Next(9);
                    }
                    else if (bombRow == batmanRow)
                    {
                        bombRow = kb.Next(9);
                        batmanRow = kb.Next(9);
                    }
                }
                
     At first I was able to anticipate that there might be a chance for the player to win automaticly, so I wrote this code, however
     I was not able to anticipate the fact that there is a chance of "...Out of Range..." exception. So I wrote the code above and this
     time I anticipated something cool, and that is the chance of an another exception caused by one of the "while"s.
     
     2. while (true) //This is to make sure everything is set up correctly
            {
            ...
            if (batmanCol <= col && batmanRow <= row)
                    if (bombCol <= col && bombRow <= row)
                        if (batmanCol != bombCol && batmanRow != bombRow)
                            break;
            }
            
            This line was not written like this originally. It was written like this
            
            while((batmanCol > col || batmanRow > row) || (bombCol == batmanCol && bombRow == batmanRow) || (bombCol > col || bombRow > row)) //This is to make sure everything is set up correctly
            {
            ...
            }
            
            So the problem with this line was that there were too many comparison operators. The problem is caused by the short circuit
            property. The code actually worked the first time, however I was suspicious that it might not work twice, so that is the reason
            why I have written it the way I wrote it at the top. However, even this version does not work right all the time.
            
    So I haven't written the play mechanics yet. I think can do that easily, however I also want to teach how to write code, so I have decided
    to show you guys the steps. There was already 3 versions of my code up until now, so I wanted to break it down. I will be working on the
    rest of the code, and I will branch it into new one. However, I either do not know how to fix this problem yet, or I haven't figured out
    how to fix it. I could enter a fixed value for the number of row and column of the "building" matrix, but that would be cheating in my
    opinion, so I'll think for a while about how to fix that problem, but it that won't happen until I am done with the play mechanics.
    
    I hope you find this useful.
    
    Thanks,

/*
    So I couldn' t trust GitHub so I put my work below my first. This code is kind of broken, because this code works the same, 
    I am not really sure of that statement, but gives different results. In one scenario it throws exception, second it gets 
    stuck in "while" (which I think I have solved that one), and finally it works. So lets start with what has chaged.
    1.  
        while (true) //This is to make sure everything is set up correctly
        {
        ...
    
                if (batmanCol <= col && batmanRow <= row)
                        if (bombCol <= col && bombRow <= row)
                            if (batmanCol != bombCol && batmanRow != bombRow)
                                //break;
                                goto outLoop;
        }
            
        outLoop:

        In the early version there was a "break" as you can see. Well I learned that "break" doesn't really work like that. So that is
        why it was stuck in "while", because it never gets the chance to get out of the loop. So I cheated a little and used "goto" 
        keyword to get out of the loop.
    2.
        for (int i = 0; i < row; i++) //This is to assign values to the matrix
                        for (int k = 0; k < col; k++)
                            building[i, k] = 0; //"0" indicates the windows

                    building[bombRow, bombCol] = 9; //"9" indicates the bomb
                    building[batmanRow, batmanCol] = 1; //"1" indicates Batman because he is #1
    
        This code's location has changed. I took it into the "while", because everytime we enter a value we want to set the new value and
        delete the old one. By placing this piece of code we can do that.
    
    So obviously this code could have been writen way better than I can, but within my knowledge this is what I have got so far. I wish
    I could do better, but I really believe this is the best I have got so far. I have tried to take you through the each step I have taken.
    
    I hope you find this useful.
    
    Thanks.

           }
           
         These lines have changed into this:
         
         while (true) //This is to make sure everything is set up correctly
            {
                while (batmanCol > col || batmanRow > row) //This is to prevent "Out of Range" exception

        I have changed "random" into simple map to ensure that the result is correct all the time. However,
        this didn't solve the problem. I still get "...Out of Range" exception.
    
    2.
        outLoop:

        }
        
        I have chaged the location of "building", because it is more optimized this way. Before it was 
        assigning the same value over and over again.
        
         while (true) //Allows the Player to play

            while (true) //This is to make sure everything is set up correctly
            {
                while (batmanCol >= col || batmanRow >= row) //This is to prevent "Out of Range" exception
                    if (batmanRow >= row)
                        batmanRow = kb.Next(9);
                    else if (batmanCol >= col)
                        batmanCol = kb.Next(9);

                while (bombCol >= col || bombRow >= row) //This is to prevent "Out of Range" exception
                    if (bombRow >= row)
                        bombRow = kb.Next(9);
                    else if (bombCol >= col)
                        bombCol = kb.Next(9);

                while (bombCol == batmanCol && bombRow == batmanRow) //This is to prevent an automatic win
                {
                    if (bombCol == batmanCol)
                    {
                        bombCol = kb.Next(9);
                        batmanCol = kb.Next(9);
                    }
                    else if (bombRow == batmanRow)
                    {
                        bombRow = kb.Next(9);
                        batmanRow = kb.Next(9);
                    }
                }

                if (batmanCol < col && batmanRow < row)
                    if (bombCol < col && bombRow < row)
                        if (batmanCol != bombCol || batmanRow != bombRow)
                            break;
            }

            I understand that it is hard to see the differences, but like they said the Devil hides in details. So I have had two
            problems that I mentioned earlier, right? One of them was the "...Out of Range" exception and the other was that there 
            was no action. So no action in this scenario means that the program is stuck in the first infinite loop, so the reason 
            behind this is the wrong use of operators.
            
            If you take a look at the operator that are inside the "if" conditions you'll see that the operators have changed.
            
            Version 2.1
            while (batmanCol > col || batmanRow > row)
            Version 2.2
            while (batmanCol >= col || batmanRow >= row)
            
            I have made this change, because the first one has a bug. When you are creating an array the maximum value of the array IS
            NOT the value you assigned, because arrays' index numbers ALWAYS start from 0, and the maximum index number is ALWAYS the
            number you have assigned minus 1. So the first code will not work when the values are equal. For example in a case, where 
            "batmanCol == col" this line will NOT catch that and it will cause an "...Out of Range" exception. This code also leads us
            to our second problem, getting stuck in while. Let take a look at these lines.
            
            Version 2.1
            if (batmanCol <= col && batmanRow <= row)
                    if (bombCol <= col && bombRow <= row)
                        if (batmanCol != bombCol && batmanRow != bombRow)
                            //break;
                            goto outLoop;
            }
            
            outLoop:
            Version 2.2
            if (batmanCol < col && batmanRow < row)
                    if (bombCol < col && bombRow < row)
                        if (batmanCol != bombCol || batmanRow != bombRow)
                            break;

            So here we got a huge problem if all the values are the same, because we'll get an "...Out of Range" exception. So, this part
            was the part where I changed first, however this lead me to another problem and that is getting stuck in the loop. Because this
            code's Version 2.2 doesn't allow equal values to "break" the loop, and because I had "if"s that don't change the equal values I
            was stuck inside the loop. Also, if you take a close look, you'll see that I have also changed "&&" to "||", because the only case
            that I don't want is the case where both of those are equal. So at this point the Version 2.2 doesn't have any bugs that I could 
            find, however this is not a good technique of how to write code, because the lenght of the "method/function" is too devistating. It
            would be better to break things into smaller "method/function"s.
            
            Also if you have realized, you'll see that I have also changed "goto" to "break", and the reason is that "goto" is more often used
            to get out of loop which is in a loop, but "break" is used to get out of one loop.
            For example:
                while (true)
                {
                    ...
                    while (true)
                    {
                        ...
                        if (...)
                            goto outLoop;
                    }
                }
                outLoop:
                Because in our case we are only inside one layer of loop, it is more approprirate to use "break".
                
                I hope you found this usefull.
